This project included extending the OMNeT++ Discrete Event Simulator (https://omnetpp.org/) with a reinforcement learning algorithm,
fuzzy logic classification, clients, and servers to a wireless access selection scenario. 

The main functionality of the model is programmed in C++ and all the description files 
are in the NED (NEtwork Description) language.
