This repository includes various C++ related projects that I have worked with. The projects are mainly extensions to the 
OMNeT++ Discrete Event Simulator (https://omnetpp.org/).

I have also programmed with the NS-3 Discrete-Event Network Simulator (https://www.nsnam.org), which is C++ based software.
