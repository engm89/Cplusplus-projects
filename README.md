This repository includes various C++ related projects that I have worked with. The projects are mainly extensions to the 
OMNeT++ Discrete Event Simulator (https://omnetpp.org/). OMNeT++ is a network simulation software, in which the main functionality is programmed in C++ and the model descriptions are programmed in Network Description Language (NED). The tool can be run both from the GUI and from the command line.

I have also programmed with the NS-3 Discrete-Event Network Simulator (https://www.nsnam.org), which is C++ based software with a possibility for Python bindings.
