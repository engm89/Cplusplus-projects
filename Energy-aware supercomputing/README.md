This project included extending the OMNeT++ Discrete Event Simulator (https://omnetpp.org/) with a simulation model of a supercomputing
data sentre. The main functionality of the model is programmed in C++ and all the description files are in the NED (NEtwork Description) 
language. 

The simulation model included models for the Resource Management System (RMS) of a super computing data centre, super computing clients,
energy models for different components of a server, and statistics collector.
