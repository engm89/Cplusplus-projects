This project included extending the OMNeT++ Discrete Event Simulator (https://omnetpp.org/) with a reinforcement learning 
algorithm to a mobile video content delivery scenario. The main functionality of the model is programmed in C++ and 
all the description files are in the NED (NEtwork Description) language.

The simulation model included models for the reinforcement learning algorithhm and a statistics collector.
